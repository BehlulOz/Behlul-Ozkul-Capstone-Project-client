# SUDOKU Game & Backtracking Algorithm Visualizer

In this Capstone project, I aimed to create a website for new web developers, seeking jobs at high-end tech companies, to help them get their brains warmed up with a SUDOKU game and learn backtracking algorithm with a visualization of the Sudoku solving process using backtracking algorithm.

#### Please enjoy the SUDOKU game while learning backtracking algorithm!
